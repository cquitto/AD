The Question 
If there are amounts of toxicity in our food and this can ruin one's life, why do we consume so much of these toxic foods?  
A general observation of the question we need to pose are the Whys:  
 Why are we obtuse or ignorant to the danger of these food? Or, why is there an obscure mysterious secret that the government is withholding from the common masses?  Why are those in power clandestine in many meetings to arcanum the truth about how much toxicity is produced in our food that our government gives a seal of endorsement?  
The attempted research will assay these questions with answers directly from accurate sources. These answers may have a bombshell effect on the cognizance minds of the common populace that have been heedless to the truth of the dangerous toxic food we consume. 
These few sources of raw data will give a brief synopsis of data that will be expound and embark upon to answer these research questions:
